  <chapter language="Packages">

    Packages provide scope and grouping for classes.

    <li id="1.0">
      <li id="1.0.1" title="Declaring a package">
        Package names are inferred directly from the directory structure of the file holding the class.

        <rationale>
          Explicit package naming from within the file will not be supported in the first release, pending feedback on
          whether it is really needed. The rationale being that nearly everybody in the Java world follows this pattern
          and deviations from it do cause confusion.
        </rationale>

        <li id="1.0.2">Package root is declared at compilation time.</li>
        <li id="1.0.3">Every directory is a package.</li>
        <li id="1.0.4">Subdirectories form subpackages in a standard tree structure.</li>
        <li id="1.0.5">Package names are case sensitive.</li>
        <li id="1.0.6">Valid characters are: a-z 0-9 $ _</li>
      </li>
    </li>

  </chapter>


  <chapter language="Classes">

    Classes group functions, methods, fields and shared constants. They are declared within a package and are usually
    within a file with the same name as the class. The exception to this are helper/embedded object declarations
    which will be covered in <ref section="3.0"/>.

    <li>
      <li id="2.0" title="Class Names">
        <li id="2.0.1">The primary class within a file must match the name of the file. Case sensitive.</li>
        <li id="2.0.2">Valid characters are a-z 0-9 $ _</li>
      </li>
